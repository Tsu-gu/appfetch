Linux users always say how package management is so much easier compared to hunting down .exe files but there are so many package formats that it becomes even harder than on Windows. I merged all verified snaps and flatpaks together, or at least tried to and also added install options for a few apps that aren't a flatpak/snap.

As the name suggests, you just tell it to fetch something and it does it. No flags, no nothing.

`appfetch app1 app1 app3 app4`, who gives a fuck what format are the apps in, I just want them from the official source.
